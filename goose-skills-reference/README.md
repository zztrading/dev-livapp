## Quick Install

## Platform Targets

```bash
npx goose-skills install google-ad-scraper --claude
npx goose-skills install google-ad-scraper --codex
npx goose-skills install google-ad-scraper --cursor --project-dir /path/to/repo
```

- `--claude` (default): installs under `~/.claude/skills/<slug>/`

- `--cursor`: installs under `~/.claude/skills/<slug>/`, then writes a project-local Cursor rule file at `.cursor/rules/goose-<slug>.mdc`

Notes:
- Only one target flag is allowed per command.
