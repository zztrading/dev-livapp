# SEO Opportunity Finder

Identify the highest-leverage content gaps between your site and competitors. Combines a crawl of your existing content with competitor keyword/traffic analysis to surface a prioritized list of posts worth writing.

**Core principle:** Don't start from a blank keyword list. Start by knowing what you have, then find what competitors have that you don't — and pick the gaps most likely to convert.

## When to Use

- "Find SEO content gaps vs our competitors"
- "What topics should we write about to rank?"
- "We're starting a blog — where should we focus first?"
- "What keywords are [competitor] ranking for that we're missing?"

## Phase 0: Intake

1. Your website URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.com`)
2. 2-3 competitor URLs to compare against
3. Primary ICP — who are you trying to attract? (This filters for commercial intent vs. general traffic)
4. Any topics/keyword themes that are definitely in scope? (Optional — helps prioritize output)

## Phase 1: Catalog Your Existing Content

Run `site-content-catalog` to build an inventory of your current pages and posts:

```bash
python3 skills/site-content-catalog/scripts/catalog_site.py \
  --url <your_site_url> \
  --output json
```

Extract from results:
- All blog post titles and URLs
- Inferred topics/themes per post
- Estimated content age (from URL slugs or metadata if available)

This prevents recommending content you've already written.

## Phase 2: Analyze Competitor SEO Footprint

Run `seo-domain-analyzer` for each competitor:

```bash
# Uses Apify Semrush/Ahrefs scrapers
node skills/seo-domain-analyzer/src/cli.js analyze --domain <competitor_domain>
```

Collect for each competitor:
- Top ranking keywords (by estimated traffic volume)
- Top pages by organic traffic
- Domain authority / DR score
- Keyword categories they're winning in

If `seo-domain-analyzer` returns limited data (low-traffic competitor), supplement with `seo-traffic-analyzer`:

```bash
python3 skills/seo-traffic-analyzer/scripts/analyze_seo.py \
  --url <competitor_url> \
  --output summary
```

## Phase 3: Identify Gaps

Compare your content inventory (Phase 1) against competitor keyword/topic coverage (Phase 2):

### Gap Classification

| Type | Definition | Priority |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Hard gap** | Competitor has a page/post on topic, you have nothing | High |
| **Soft gap** | You have content on topic but it's thin (< 500 words, old, no depth) | Medium |
| **Positioning gap** | Competitor owns a keyword cluster that maps to your ICP's exact problem | High |
| **Informational gap** | High traffic, low commercial intent — good for awareness, not conversion | Low |

### Commercial Intent Filter

For each gap topic, score commercial intent (1-5):
- **5** — Directly maps to your product (e.g., "best AI SDR tools for startups")
- **4** — Problem-aware but not product-specific (e.g., "how to scale outbound SDR")
- **3** — Adjacent pain point (e.g., "cold email open rates benchmark 2026")
- **2** — Educational, tangential (e.g., "what is lead scoring")
- **1** — Generic traffic, low conversion potential

Prioritize gaps with score ≥ 3.

## Phase 4: Synthesize & Output

Produce a prioritized opportunity table + editorial brief starters:

```markdown
