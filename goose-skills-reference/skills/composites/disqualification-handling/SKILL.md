# Disqualification Handling

Processes leads that didn't pass ICP qualification. Instead of ignoring them, this composite handles each category appropriately: polite rejection, referral request, or nurture routing. No inbound lead should feel ghosted.

## When to Auto-Load

Load this composite when:
- User says "handle the disqualified leads", "draft rejection emails", "what do we do with the ones that didn't qualify?"
- `inbound-lead-qualification` has completed and disqualified/near-miss leads need handling
- User has a list of leads that don't fit and wants appropriate responses

## Architecture

```
[Disqualified Leads] → Step 1: Categorize → Step 2: Draft Responses → Step 3: Route to Destination
                              ↓                      ↓                         ↓
                     4 handling categories    Tailored email per type    Nurture/CRM/archive
```

---

## Step 0: Configuration (Once Per Client)

On first run, establish response preferences. Save to `clients/<client-name>/config/disqualification-handling.json`.

```json
{
  "sender_name": "",
  "sender_title": "",
  "company_name": "",
  "tone": "warm-professional | casual-friendly | formal",
  "nurture_sequence_tool": "Smartlead | HubSpot | Mailchimp | CSV export | none",
  "referral_incentive": "none | mention mutual value | offer resource",
  "include_resource_link": true,
  "resource_url": "",
  "resource_description": "",
  "feedback_survey_url": "",
  "do_not_contact_list": "Supabase | CSV | none"
}
```

**On subsequent runs:** Load config silently.

---

## Step 1: Categorize Disqualified Leads

### Input
Leads from `inbound-lead-qualification` with sub-verdicts. Categorize each into one of four handling paths:

### Category 1: Right Company, Wrong Person → REFERRAL REQUEST
**Trigger:** `mismatch_type = right_company_wrong_person`
- The company fits ICP but the person who came inbound isn't a buyer/champion/user
- Example: A marketing intern at a perfect-fit company downloaded a whitepaper
- Goal: Get an introduction to the right person at that company

**Identify the referral target:**
- Using the ICP's buyer personas, determine who at this company we SHOULD be talking to
- If enrichment data or CRM has other contacts at the company, note them (but still ask for the intro — warmer than cold outreach)

### Category 2: Close But Not Quite → NURTURE (FUTURE FIT)
**Trigger:** `sub_verdict = near_miss_nurture` OR score 30-49 without a referral opportunity
- Company is almost ICP but not today — too small, too early stage, wrong geography (but expanding), missing a key requirement that might change
- Example: A 15-person startup that's clearly growing fast but below your 50-employee minimum
- Goal: Stay on their radar. When they hit the threshold, you're top of mind.

### Category 3: Clearly Outside ICP → POLITE DECLINE
**Trigger:** `sub_verdict = disqualified_polite` OR score < 30
- Not a fit now and unlikely to become one
- Example: A freelancer, a student, a company in an excluded industry
- Goal: Decline gracefully. Don't burn bridges — they might refer someone, post about you, or their situation might change unexpectedly.

### Category 4: Special Flags → ROUTE DIFFERENTLY
**Trigger:** `sub_verdict = disqualified_competitor` OR `pipeline_status = existing_customer`
- **Competitor employee:** Do NOT send a rejection email. Log for competitive intelligence. No outreach.
- **Existing customer:** Do NOT treat as disqualified. Route to customer success / account management. May be an upsell or support need.

### Output
Each lead tagged with: `handling_category`, `handling_action`, `referral_target_persona` (for Category 1)

---

## Step 2: Draft Responses

### Category 1 Response: Referral Request Email

**Objective:** Thank them, subtly indicate they may not be the right person, and ask for an introduction — without making them feel dismissed.

**Structure:**
1. **Thank them** for their interest (reference what they did — demo request, download, etc.)
2. **Acknowledge their role** — show you understand what they do
3. **Pivot to the right person** — frame it as "wanting to make sure the right person gets the most value"
4. **Make the ask easy** — provide a specific persona/title to connect you with
5. **Offer something in return** — a resource relevant to THEIR role (not just the buyer's)

**Template framework:**

```
Subject: Thanks for checking us out, [First Name]

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for [downloading our guide on X / requesting a demo / signing up for the trial].
[One sentence connecting their action to a genuine insight — "it's a great resource for
understanding Y."]

I took a look at [Company] — [one sentence showing you understand the company].
Given what [Product] does, I think [target persona title, e.g., "your VP of Engineering"
or "whoever leads infrastructure decisions"] would get the most out of a conversation
with us.

Would you be open to making an introduction? Happy to send you a quick blurb you
can forward, so it's zero effort on your end.

[If resource_link configured: "In the meantime, here's [resource] that might be
useful for [something relevant to THEIR role]."]

Thanks,
[Sender Name]
```

**Rules:**
- Never say "you're not the right person" or "you don't have buying authority"
- Never use the word "unfortunately" or "however"
- Frame the referral as maximizing value, not correcting a mistake
- Keep it under 120 words
- If you know the specific name of the right person (from enrichment/CRM), mention them: "I think [Name] on your [team] would find this valuable"

### Category 2 Response: Nurture Warm-Down Email

**Objective:** Keep the relationship warm without false promises. Position yourself as a future resource.

**Structure:**
1. **Thank them** for their interest
2. **Be honest (but tactful)** about fit — don't say "you're disqualified", say "given where [Company] is today, the timing might not be perfect"
3. **Offer genuine value** — share a resource relevant to their current stage/situation
4. **Leave the door open** — invite them to reach out when circumstances change
5. **No hard CTA** — this is a soft touch, not a sales push

**Template framework:**

```
Subject: [First Name] — thanks for your interest in [Product]

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for [action they took]. I looked into [Company] and really like
[genuine compliment — what they're building, their growth, their approach].

Based on where [Company] is right now, I think [honest reason the timing
isn't right, framed positively — e.g., "you'd get the most value from us
once your team scales past X" or "this tends to be most impactful after Y
milestone"].

In the meantime, [here's a resource / I'd recommend / you might find this useful] —
[brief description of why it's relevant to them NOW, not just to your product].

I'll keep an eye on [Company] — would love to reconnect when the timing
is better. Feel free to reach out anytime.

Best,
[Sender Name]
```

**Rules:**
- Never say "disqualified", "not a fit", "don't meet our criteria"
- Frame timing as the issue, not them — "not yet" beats "not ever"
- The shared resource should be genuinely useful to them at their current stage, not just a product pitch
- Keep it under 100 words
- Warm but not overly familiar

### Category 3 Response: Polite Decline Email

**Objective:** Decline gracefully while leaving a positive impression of your brand.

**Structure:**
1. **Thank them** for their interest
2. **Brief honest explanation** — keep it high-level ("we specialize in X and it sounds like you need Y")
3. **Redirect if possible** — suggest an alternative tool/service if you know one
4. **Close warmly**

**Template framework:**

```
Subject: Thanks for reaching out, [First Name]

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for your interest in [Product]. I appreciate you taking the time to
[action they took].

We're focused specifically on [your niche/ICP in plain language], and it
sounds like [their situation — framed neutrally, not critically] might be
a different use case from what we're built for.

[If you know an alternative: "You might want to check out [Alternative] —
they're strong for [their actual need]."]

[If no alternative: "I don't want to waste your time, but if your needs
evolve, we'd be happy to chat."]

Best of luck with [something specific to their situation],
[Sender Name]
```

**Rules:**
- Never apologize ("sorry we can't help") — you're not obligated
- Never be dismissive or condescending
- Keep it under 80 words
- If you can genuinely suggest an alternative, do — it builds goodwill
- Don't over-explain why they don't fit. One sentence is enough.

### Category 4: No Email

- **Competitor:** Add to competitive intel tracking. No outbound response. Log: "Competitor employee [Name] from [Company] engaged via [source] on [date]."
- **Existing customer:** Draft a brief internal routing note: "Existing customer [Company] ([contact name]) came inbound via [source]. Current plan: [plan]. Account owner: [owner]. Possible upsell signal." Route to CS/AM.

---

## Step 3: Route to Destination

### For Each Category:

| Category | Email Action | CRM Action | Sequence Action |
|----------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Referral Request | Draft ready for human review & send | Tag as `referral_pending` | None — single touch |
| Nurture | Draft ready for human review & send | Tag as `nurture_future_fit`, set reminder for re-evaluation in 3-6 months | Add to nurture drip if configured |
| Polite Decline | Draft ready for human review & send | Tag as `disqualified_responded`, note reason | None — single touch |
| Competitor | No email | Tag as `competitor_employee`, log in competitive intel | None |
| Existing Customer | No sales email | Flag for CS/AM team, note the inbound action | None |

### Nurture Sequence Setup (Category 2)

If a nurture sequence tool is configured:
1. Group nurture leads by their "why not yet" reason — this determines the drip content
2. Suggest sequence themes:
   - "Too small right now" → Growth-stage content, case studies of similar companies that grew into ICP
   - "Wrong stage" → Stage-appropriate content, milestone-based check-ins
   - "Missing requirement" → Product update notifications, roadmap content
3. Add to appropriate sequence or produce a CSV for manual import

### Re-Evaluation Triggers

For Category 2 (nurture) leads, define when to re-evaluate:
- Company raises funding → re-run qualification
- Company headcount crosses threshold → re-run qualification
- Person gets promoted → re-run qualification
- 6 months have passed → manual re-evaluation prompt

If signal composites are active (`funding-signal-outreach`, `hiring-signal-outreach`, `champion-move-outreach`), these triggers happen automatically.

- **Known contacts at company:** [from enrichment/CRM, if any]
- **Draft email:**
  > [email draft]

---

### Nurture — Review & Send

#### [Name] — [Title] at [Company]
- **Why not yet:** [one sentence — e.g., "20 employees, ICP starts at 50"]
- **Re-evaluate when:** [trigger — e.g., "headcount crosses 50" or "6 months"]
- **Draft email:**
  > [email draft]

---

### Polite Decline — Review & Send

#### [Name] — [Title] at [Company]
- **Why not a fit:** [one sentence]
- **Suggested alternative:** [if known]
- **Draft email:**
  > [email draft]

---

### Flagged (No Outreach)

```

### Secondary: CSV Export

Append to the qualification CSV or produce a separate handling CSV:
- All lead fields + `handling_category`, `handling_action`, `email_draft`, `referral_target`, `nurture_trigger`, `re_evaluate_date`

Save to: `clients/<client-name>/leads/disqualification-handling-[date].csv`

---

## Handling Edge Cases

**Lead who's clearly a bot or spam:**
Skip all categories. Tag as `spam` and archive. Don't waste an email draft. Signs: gibberish name, test@test.com, form filled in < 2 seconds, obvious fake company.

**Lead who requested a demo but is clearly disqualified:**
Still draft a polite decline. A demo request deserves a human response even if the answer is no. Consider: if they're a strong referral opportunity (right company), prioritize the referral path over the decline path.

**Lead at a competitor's customer:**
This is NOT a competitor employee — this is someone at a company that uses a competitor. They came inbound, which means they might be looking to switch. Do NOT disqualify. Route back to qualification as a high-priority signal.

**Multiple people from the same company, some qualified, some not:**
For disqualified people at a company where someone else qualified: Draft a softer version that acknowledges "we're already in touch with your team at [Company]" — don't send a rejection to someone whose colleague is in active talks.

**Lead who's a journalist, analyst, or investor:**
Not a customer, but not a "decline" either. Flag separately: "Non-customer interest from [Name], [Role] at [Publication/Fund]. May be PR/AR opportunity." Route to marketing or founder.

**Very high-volume batches (50+ disqualified):**
- Category 3 (polite decline) and Category 2 (nurture) can use lighter-touch templates rather than personalized drafts
- Category 1 (referral requests) should always be personalized — these are the highest-value disqualified leads

---

## Email Hard Rules

All draft emails must follow these rules regardless of category:

1. **No lies.** Don't say "we'd love to work with you" if you're declining them.
2. **No guilt.** Don't make them feel bad for reaching out.
3. **No jargon.** "ICP", "qualification", "disqualified" never appear in emails.
4. **Brevity.** Referral < 120 words. Nurture < 100 words. Decline < 80 words.
5. **One CTA maximum.** Referral: make the intro. Nurture: check the resource. Decline: none or soft redirect.
6. **No false urgency.** These are goodwill emails, not sales emails.
7. **Genuine value.** If you offer a resource, it should actually help them — not be a disguised pitch.
8. **Reply-friendly.** Write in a way that they COULD reply if they wanted to. No "noreply" energy.

## Tools Required

- **Email drafting** — references `email-drafting` capability for tone and structure
- **CRM access** — to update lead status, add tags, set reminders
- **Nurture sequence tool** — to add leads to drip campaigns (Smartlead, HubSpot, etc.)
- **Supabase client** — for pipeline lookups and signal cross-reference
- **Read/Write** — for CSV output and config management
