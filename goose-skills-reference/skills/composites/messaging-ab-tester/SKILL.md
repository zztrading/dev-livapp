# Messaging A/B Tester

Stop debating which message is better — test it. Generate messaging variants, deploy them through real channels, and measure which framing actually resonates with your ICP.

**Core principle:** At seed/Series A, you don't have enough traffic for website A/B tests. But you do have enough LinkedIn impressions and cold email sends to test messaging angles fast.

## When to Use

- "Which of these value props should we lead with?"
- "Test our messaging angles and tell me which works"
- "I can't decide between [message A] and [message B]"
- "What messaging resonates most with [ICP]?"
- "Run a messaging test for [product/feature]"

## Phase 0: Intake

### What to Test
1. **Core value prop** — The claim or positioning you want to test (e.g., "We help growth teams run outbound 10x faster")
2. **Test goal** — What are you deciding? (Headline for website, cold email angle, LinkedIn content strategy, ad copy direction)
3. **ICP** — Who should this resonate with? (Title, company type, stage)
4. **Current messaging** — What are you using today? (Baseline to beat)

### Test Channel
5. **Where to test:**
   - **LinkedIn organic** — Post variants across consecutive days, compare engagement
   - **Cold email** — A/B test subject lines or opening hooks via Smartlead
   - **Both** — Run in parallel for fastest signal
6. **Sample size available:**
   - LinkedIn: followers/typical impressions per post
   - Email: list size available for testing

### Constraints
7. **Number of variants** — 3-5 recommended (more = slower signal)
8. **Test duration** — How long to run? (Default: 1 week for LinkedIn, 3-5 days for email)

## Phase 1: Generate Messaging Variants

Create 3-5 variants that test different **angles**, not just different words. Each variant should represent a distinct strategic bet:

### Variant Types

| Type | What It Tests | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Outcome-driven** | Leading with the result | "3x your pipeline in 30 days" |
| **Pain-driven** | Leading with the problem | "Tired of spending 4 hours a day on manual prospecting?" |
| **Identity-driven** | Leading with who they are | "Built for growth teams who move fast" |
| **Proof-driven** | Leading with evidence | "How [Customer] went from 10 to 50 demos/month" |
| **Contrast-driven** | Leading with what you're not | "Not another CRM. An outbound engine." |

### Variant Template

For each variant:
```
VARIANT [N]: [Type — e.g., "Outcome-driven"]

Hypothesis: This framing will resonate because [reasoning tied to ICP psychology]

LinkedIn post version:
---
[Full post copy — 100-200 words, native LinkedIn format]
---

Email subject line version:
[Subject line — max 50 chars]

Email opening hook version:
[First 2 sentences of an email]

Headline version:
[Website headline — max 10 words]
```

## Phase 2: Deploy Tests

### Option A: LinkedIn Organic Test

**Setup:**
1. Schedule variants as consecutive posts (1 per day, same time of day)
2. Each post should be similar length and format (control for post structure)
3. Don't boost any posts — organic only for clean comparison

**Measurement (after 48 hours per post):**
- Impressions
- Reactions (likes, celebrates, etc.)
- Comments
- Comment sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
- Profile visits (if trackable)
- DMs received mentioning the post

### Option B: Cold Email A/B Test

**Setup via Smartlead:**
1. Create campaign with all variants as A/B test sequences
2. Split list evenly across variants (minimum 50 per variant for signal)
3. Same send time, same sender, same CTA — only the messaging changes

**Measurement (after 5 days):**
- Open rate (tests subject line)
- Reply rate (tests full message resonance)
- Positive reply rate (tests conversion quality)
- Click rate (if link included)

### Option C: Both (Recommended)

Run LinkedIn and email in parallel. Different channels may show different winners — that's valuable signal about where each message works best.

## Phase 3: Analyze Results

### Scoring Framework

| Metric | Weight (LinkedIn) | Weight (Email) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Engagement rate | 30% | — |
| Comment quality | 30% | — |
| Open rate | — | 30% |
| Reply rate | — | 40% |
| Positive reply rate | — | 30% |
| Impressions | 20% | — |
| Profile visits / clicks | 20% | — |

### Statistical Significance Check

For email tests:
- **Minimum sends per variant:** 50 (for directional signal), 200+ (for confident decisions)
- **Minimum difference to call a winner:** >20% relative difference in primary metric

For LinkedIn tests:
- **Minimum posts per variant:** 1 (you're testing with limited data — treat as directional)
- **Minimum impressions:** 500 per post to be comparable

### Winner Selection

```
WINNER: Variant [N] — [Type]

Primary metric: [X] (vs average of [Y] across other variants)
Relative improvement: [Z%] over baseline

Why it won:
[1-2 sentences on what this tells us about ICP messaging preferences]

Runner-up: Variant [N]
[1 sentence on when this might work better — different channel, different segment]
```

## What to Test Next

Based on these results, the next messaging test should explore:
1. [Angle suggested by results — e.g., "test more specific proof points since proof-driven won"]
2. [Segment test — e.g., "test winning message against different ICP segment"]
```
