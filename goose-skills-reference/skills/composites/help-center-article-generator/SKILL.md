# Help Center Article Generator

Turn support tickets into self-serve answers. Takes repeated questions, feature docs, or product specs and generates help center articles that reduce ticket volume.

**Built for:** Early-stage teams where the same 20 questions make up 80% of support tickets, and nobody has time to write help docs. The goal is to turn one afternoon of article generation into months of ticket deflection.

## When to Use

- "Write help center articles for our top support questions"
- "Turn these support tickets into FAQ articles"
- "Generate docs for [feature]"
- "Build out our knowledge base"
- "Our support volume is too high — help me create self-serve content"

## Phase 0: Intake

### Content Source (provide any/all)
1. **Support ticket export** — CSV/list of recent tickets (subject, description, resolution). The skill will cluster them to find the top recurring topics.
2. **FAQ list** — Already know the top questions? Provide them directly.
3. **Feature documentation** — Internal docs, PRDs, or specs for features that need customer-facing articles.
4. **Product walkthrough** — Describe the workflow step-by-step and the skill generates the article.
5. **Existing articles to improve** — URLs or text of current help articles that need rewriting.

### Configuration
6. **Product name** — What's the product called?
7. **Audience** — Who reads these? (Technical users, non-technical, mixed)
8. **Tone** — Casual/friendly, professional, technical/developer-docs?
9. **Article structure preference:**
   - **Standard** — Overview → Steps → Troubleshooting → Related
   - **Developer** — Overview → API reference → Code examples → Errors
   - **Quick start** — What → Why → How (3 steps max) → Next
10. **Screenshot convention** — Do you use screenshots? (The skill will insert `[Screenshot: description]` placeholders)
11. **Batch or single?** — One article or generate multiple from a ticket export?

## Phase 1: Topic Clustering (Batch Mode)

If provided a ticket export, cluster tickets into article topics:

### Clustering Approach

1. **Group by similarity** — Cluster tickets with similar subject/description
2. **Rank by frequency** — Most common clusters = highest priority articles
3. **Identify article type** per cluster:

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **How-to** | "How do I do X?" | "How to set up email integration" |
| **Troubleshooting** | "X isn't working" | "Fix: emails not sending" |
| **Concept/Overview** | "What is X?" | "Understanding billing plans" |
| **Reference** | "What are the options for X?" | "API rate limits and quotas" |
| **Getting Started** | First-time setup | "Quick start: your first campaign" |

### Cluster Output

```
TOPIC CLUSTERS (ranked by ticket frequency):

1. [Topic] — [N tickets] — Type: [How-to]
   Common phrasing: "[How customers ask this question]"
   Resolution pattern: [What support typically tells them]

2. [Topic] — [N tickets] — Type: [Troubleshooting]
   ...

3. ...
```

- [ ] **Complete** — Covers the full workflow, not just the happy path
- [ ] **Troubleshooting included** — At least 2 common failure scenarios
- [ ] **No jargon** — Uses the customer's language, not internal terminology
- [ ] **Screenshot placeholders** — Every step that involves UI has a placeholder
- [ ] **Related articles linked** — Cross-references to keep users in the help center
- [ ] **Search-friendly** — Title and first paragraph contain keywords customers actually search for
