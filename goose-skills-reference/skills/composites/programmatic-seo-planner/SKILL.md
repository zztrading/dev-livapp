# Programmatic SEO Page Planner

Programmatic SEO is how startups generate hundreds of high-intent pages from templates — "{Your Product} vs {Competitor}", "Best {Category} for {Industry}", "{Integration} + {Your Product}". This skill figures out which patterns are worth building, designs the templates, and prioritizes the buildout.

**Core principle:** pSEO isn't about spinning content. It's about finding a data axis (something that varies per page) where each variation has real search demand and your product has a genuine answer. This skill validates both before you invest in building.

## When to Use

- "How do we scale SEO pages without writing each one manually?"
- "Should we build vs/ comparison pages?"
- "What programmatic SEO patterns work for SaaS?"
- "How can we rank for hundreds of long-tail keywords?"
- "Plan our pSEO strategy"

## Tool Enhancement (Optional)

This skill works with existing capabilities but produces significantly better results when paired with a keyword data API for bulk volume lookups across hundreds of long-tail variations.

### Agent Prompt to User

> "I can plan your programmatic SEO strategy using our existing tools. However, for the best results — especially accurate search volume data across hundreds of keyword variations — I'd recommend connecting a keyword data API."
>
> **Recommended: DataForSEO** (pay-per-use, ~$0.01/keyword, no monthly minimum)
> - Sign up at dataforseo.com → get API login + password
> - Set `DATAFORSEO_LOGIN` and `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD` env vars
>
> **Alternatives that also work:**
> - **Keywords Everywhere API** ($1 per 10 credits = 100K keywords, very cheap) → set `KEYWORDS_EVERYWHERE_API_KEY`
> - **SEMrush API** (if you have a subscription) → set `SEMRUSH_API_KEY`
> - **Ahrefs API** (if you have a subscription) → set `AHREFS_API_TOKEN`
>
> "Want to use one of these, or should I proceed with baseline mode? Baseline still works — I'll use our Apify-based SEO tools for top-level data, though volume estimates for individual long-tail patterns will be less precise."

### Mode Selection

- **Enhanced mode** — Bulk keyword volume lookups via DataForSEO / Keywords Everywhere / SEMrush / Ahrefs. Gets exact monthly search volume, keyword difficulty, and CPC for each pattern variation. Enables confident prioritization.
- **Baseline mode** — Uses `seo-domain-analyzer` (Apify) for domain-level metrics and `web_search` for pattern validation. Volume estimates are directional, not exact. Still produces a solid blueprint — just less granular on per-variation demand.

## Phase 0: Intake

1. **Your product** — URL + one-sentence description
2. **Category** — What category/market do you play in?
3. **Competitors** — 3-5 competitor URLs (we'll analyze their pSEO plays)
4. **ICP** — Who's searching for your product? (roles, industries, company stages)
5. **Existing content** — Do you already have a blog/resource section? (URL if yes)
6. **CMS/tech stack** — What powers your site? (Webflow, WordPress, Next.js, etc.) — informs template feasibility
7. **Tool preference** — Enhanced mode with keyword API, or baseline? (see Tool Enhancement above)

## Phase 1: Pattern Discovery

### 1A: Competitor pSEO Analysis

Run `site-content-catalog` for each competitor:

```bash
python3 skills/site-content-catalog/scripts/catalog_site.py \
  --url "<competitor_url>" \
  --output json
```

Analyze URL structures for programmatic patterns:
- `/vs/`, `/compare/`, `/alternatives/` — Comparison pages
- `/integrations/`, `/connect/`, `/apps/` — Integration pages
- `/for-{industry}/`, `/solutions/`, `/use-cases/` — Vertical/use-case pages
- `/templates/`, `/examples/`, `/glossary/` — Resource pages
- `/tools/`, `/calculators/`, `/generators/` — Tool pages

For each pattern found, note:
- URL pattern (regex)
- Estimated page count
- What varies per page (the "data axis")
- Sample page titles

### 1B: Market Pattern Mapping

Based on your product category, evaluate these standard pSEO pattern types:

| Pattern Type | URL Structure | Data Axis | Best For |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| **Versus/Comparison** | /vs/{competitor} | Competitor names | High-intent, bottom-funnel |
| **Alternatives** | /alternatives/{competitor} | Competitor names | Displacement queries |
| **Integrations** | /integrations/{tool} | Tool/app names | Mid-funnel, ecosystem |
| **Industry verticals** | /for/{industry} | Industry names | Vertical targeting |
| **Use cases** | /use-cases/{use-case} | Job-to-be-done | Mid-funnel, discovery |
| **Glossary/Definitions** | /glossary/{term} | Industry terms | Top-funnel, authority |
| **Templates/Examples** | /templates/{type} | Template types | Mid-funnel, utility |
| **Tools/Calculators** | /tools/{tool-name} | Tool functions | Top-funnel, link bait |
| **Location pages** | /{service}-in-{city} | City/region names | Local-intent (if relevant) |

### 1C: Customer Language Mining

Run `reddit-scraper` to find how ICP talks about the problem:

```bash
python3 skills/reddit-scraper/scripts/scrape_reddit.py \
  --query "<category> OR <problem keyword>" \
  --subreddits "<relevant_subs>" \
  --sort relevance --time year --limit 50
```

Extract:
- Questions people ask → potential glossary/guide patterns
- "How do I [X] with [tool]?" → integration/use-case patterns
- "Is there a [X] for [industry]?" → vertical page patterns
- Comparison discussions → vs/ page patterns

### 1D: Keyword Volume Validation

**Enhanced mode (DataForSEO / Keywords Everywhere / SEMrush / Ahrefs):**

For each candidate pattern, generate 20-50 keyword variations and pull exact volumes:
- "your-product vs {competitor1}", "your-product vs {competitor2}", etc.
- "best {category} for {industry1}", "best {category} for {industry2}", etc.
- "{your-product} {integration1} integration", etc.

Aggregate per pattern type:
- Total addressable monthly searches across all variations
- Average volume per variation
- Volume distribution (are a few variations high-volume or is it evenly spread?)
- Average keyword difficulty

**Baseline mode:**

Use `seo-domain-analyzer` for competitor domain metrics, `web_search` to spot-check if key variations have SERP results (indicating real demand), and manual estimation based on:
- Competitor page count per pattern (more pages = likely more demand)
- Google autocomplete suggestions for pattern variations
- Reddit/community question frequency

## Phase 2: Pattern Evaluation

Score each candidate pattern on:

| Factor | Weight | How to Assess |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Search demand** | 30% | Total addressable volume across all variations |
| **Intent quality** | 25% | How close to purchase decision? (vs/ = high, glossary = low) |
| **Template feasibility** | 20% | Can you create a useful, differentiated page from a template? |
| **Data availability** | 15% | Can you programmatically source the data that varies? |
| **Competitive gap** | 10% | Are competitors NOT doing this pattern, or doing it poorly? |

Score each pattern 0-100. Rank by score.

### Feasibility Check Per Pattern

For each pattern scoring 50+, validate:

1. **Data source** — Where does the variable data come from?
   - Competitor names → manual list (finite, high-value)
   - Integration/tool names → API marketplace, app directory
   - Industry names → standard industry lists
   - Terms/glossary → keyword research output
   - Templates → product feature matrix

2. **Content differentiation** — Can each page offer genuine value, or will they be thin?
   - vs/ pages need real feature comparisons, not just "we're better"
   - Integration pages need actual setup guides or use cases
   - Vertical pages need industry-specific pain points and examples

3. **Technical feasibility** — Can your CMS generate these at scale?
   - Static site generators (Next.js, Astro) → excellent for pSEO
   - Webflow CMS → good, max 10K items per collection
   - WordPress → good with custom post types
   - Manual creation → not pSEO, just a lot of pages

## Phase 3: Template Design

For each pattern being built, design:

### Template Blueprint

```markdown
## Pattern: [vs/{competitor}]

### URL Structure
/vs/{competitor-slug}

### Title Template
{Your Product} vs {Competitor} — [Year] Comparison | {Your Brand}

### Meta Description Template
Compare {Your Product} and {Competitor} side-by-side. See pricing, features,
pros/cons, and which is better for {ICP description}.

### H1
{Your Product} vs {Competitor}: Honest Comparison

### Page Sections (content framework)
1. **TL;DR** — 3-sentence summary of key differences (above fold)
2. **Quick comparison table** — Feature matrix with checkmarks
3. **Detailed comparison** — 4-6 key dimensions, 2-3 paragraphs each
4. **Pricing comparison** — Plan-by-plan breakdown
5. **Who should choose {Your Product}** — ICP fit description
6. **Who should choose {Competitor}** — Fair assessment
7. **What real users say** — Review quotes from both sides
8. **CTA** — Trial/demo prompt

### Data Required Per Page
- competitor_name: string
- competitor_slug: string
- competitor_features: array (from their website/docs)
- competitor_pricing: object (from pricing page)
- competitor_reviews: array (from G2/Capterra)
- your_differentiators: array (per competitor)

### Content Guidelines
- Minimum 1,500 words per page
- Must include at least one unique insight (not just feature lists)
- Use actual screenshots or diagrams where possible
- Update quarterly (pricing/features change)
```

Repeat for each pattern type.

## Phase 4: Prioritization & Roadmap

Build the implementation plan:

### Priority Matrix

| Pattern | Score | Est. Pages | Volume/Page | Total Volume | Build Effort | Priority |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| vs/ comparisons | 85 | 15 | 300 | 4,500 | Medium | P0 — Build first |
| integrations/ | 72 | 40 | 80 | 3,200 | High | P1 — Build second |
| for-{industry}/ | 68 | 12 | 200 | 2,400 | Medium | P1 — Build second |
| alternatives-to/ | 65 | 8 | 250 | 2,000 | Low | P0 — Quick win |
| glossary/ | 45 | 100 | 40 | 4,000 | Low | P2 — Authority play |

### Recommended Buildout Sequence

**Month 1: Quick wins**
- Build [pattern A] — [X] pages, [rationale]
- Build [pattern B] — [X] pages, [rationale]

**Month 2: Scale**
- Build [pattern C] — [X] pages, [rationale]
- Measure Month 1 patterns, iterate templates

**Month 3: Expand**
- Build [pattern D] — [X] pages, [rationale]
- Update Month 1 pages with performance data

### Per-Pattern Data Source Plan

For each pattern, specify exactly where the variable data comes from:
- Manual curation (competitors list — finite, high quality)
- API source (integration marketplace)
- Scraping (review sites, competitor pages)
- Internal data (product features, pricing)

## Phase 5: Output

```markdown
# Programmatic SEO Blueprint — [Product Name] — [DATE]

## Executive Summary
- [N] patterns evaluated, [M] recommended for buildout
