# Voice of Customer Synthesizer

Turn scattered customer feedback into a single source of truth. Aggregates signals from every source you have, clusters them into themes, and produces a report that product, marketing, and CS teams can actually act on.

**Built for:** Startups where customer feedback lives in 6 different places and nobody has time to synthesize it. The founder says "what are customers saying?" and nobody has a clear answer. This skill produces that answer.

## When to Use

- "What are our customers saying?"
- "Synthesize customer feedback from last quarter"
- "Build a VoC report for the product team"
- "What themes are coming up in customer feedback?"
- "Aggregate feedback from all our channels"

## Phase 0: Intake

### Feedback Sources (provide all you have)
1. **Support tickets** — Export from support tool (CSV: customer, date, subject, description, tags, resolution)
2. **NPS/CSAT survey responses** — Scores + verbatim comments
3. **Slack messages** — Customer channel messages, feedback channels
4. **G2/Capterra reviews** — Will scrape if product is listed (provide product name or URL)
5. **Call/meeting transcripts** — Customer call recordings or notes
6. **Churn exit survey responses** — Why did customers leave?
7. **Feature request log** — Internal tracker of what customers have asked for
8. **Social mentions** — Twitter/LinkedIn/Reddit threads mentioning your product
9. **Email threads** — Notable customer emails (praise or complaints)
10. **In-app feedback** — Any in-product feedback submissions

### Configuration
11. **Time period** — What window to analyze? (Last 30 days, quarter, 6 months)
12. **Product name** — For review scraping and context
13. **Report audience** — Who's reading this? (Product team, exec team, CS team, all)
14. **Focus areas** — Any specific themes to pay attention to? (e.g., "onboarding experience", "pricing feedback", "mobile app")

## Phase 1: Data Collection

### 1A: Internal Data Processing

From the provided inputs, normalize all feedback into a standard format:

```
SOURCE | DATE | CUSTOMER | SEGMENT | FEEDBACK_TEXT | SENTIMENT | CATEGORY
```

Sentiment classification per item:
- **Positive** — Praise, satisfaction, delight
- **Neutral** — Feature request, question, observation
- **Negative** — Complaint, frustration, disappointment
- **Critical** — Churn threat, escalation, anger

### 1B: External Review Scraping (if applicable)

If product is on review platforms:

```
Chain: review-scraper for G2, Capterra, Trustpilot
Filter: reviews from the target time period
```

Extract: rating, review text, reviewer role/company size, date, pros, cons.

### 1C: Social Listening (if applicable)

```
Search: "[product name]" feedback OR review OR "switched to" OR "stopped using"
Search: "[product name]" site:reddit.com OR site:twitter.com
```

## Phase 2: Theme Clustering

Group all feedback items into themes using a bottom-up approach:

### Clustering Method

1. Read all feedback items
2. Identify recurring topics (mentioned by 3+ customers or in 3+ sources)
3. Group into theme clusters
4. Rank by frequency AND severity

### Theme Template

```
THEME: [Name — e.g., "Onboarding Complexity"]
FREQUENCY: [N mentions across M sources]
SENTIMENT: [Predominantly positive/neutral/negative]
TREND: [↑ Growing / → Stable / ↓ Declining vs prior period]

REPRESENTATIVE QUOTES:
- "[Exact quote]" — [Source, Customer segment, Date]
- "[Exact quote]" — [Source, Customer segment, Date]
- "[Exact quote]" — [Source, Customer segment, Date]

CUSTOMER SEGMENTS AFFECTED:
- [Segment 1: e.g., "New customers in first 30 days"]
- [Segment 2: e.g., "Enterprise accounts"]

ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS:
[1-2 sentences: Why is this coming up? What's the underlying issue?]

IMPACT:
- On retention: [High/Medium/Low]
- On expansion: [High/Medium/Low]
- On acquisition: [High/Medium/Low]
```

## Phase 3: Analysis

### 3A: Sentiment Overview

```
Overall Sentiment Distribution:
  Positive:  [N] items ([X%])  ████████░░
  Neutral:   [N] items ([X%])  ████░░░░░░
  Negative:  [N] items ([X%])  ██░░░░░░░░
  Critical:  [N] items ([X%])  █░░░░░░░░░
```

### 3B: Source Comparison

| Source | Volume | Avg Sentiment | Top Theme |
|--------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Support tickets | [N] | [Pos/Neg score] | [Theme] |
| NPS comments | [N] | [Score] | [Theme] |
| G2 reviews | [N] | [Score] | [Theme] |
| Slack | [N] | [Score] | [Theme] |
| Calls | [N] | [Score] | [Theme] |

**Insight:** Different sources often reveal different stories. Support tickets skew negative (problems). Reviews skew bipolar (love/hate). Calls reveal nuance. Note where themes appear across sources for highest confidence.

### 3C: Segment Analysis

| Customer Segment | Dominant Sentiment | Top Request | Key Pain |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| [New customers] | [Sentiment] | [Request] | [Pain] |
| [Power users] | [Sentiment] | [Request] | [Pain] |
| [Enterprise] | [Sentiment] | [Request] | [Pain] |
| [Churned] | [Sentiment] | [Request] | [Pain] |

### 3D: Trend Detection

Compare against prior period (if available):

| Theme | Prior Period | This Period | Trend | Alert |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------|-------|
| [Theme 1] | [N mentions] | [N mentions] | [↑X%] | [New/Growing/Stable/Declining] |
| [Theme 2] | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**New themes this period:** [Themes that weren't present before]
**Resolved themes:** [Themes that decreased significantly — things you fixed]
