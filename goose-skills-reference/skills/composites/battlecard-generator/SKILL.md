# Battlecard Generator

Research a competitor from every public angle — website, reviews, ads, social, pricing — and produce a structured sales battlecard. The output is what a rep opens 5 minutes before a competitive deal.

**Built for:** PMMs building competitive programs without a dedicated competitive intel team. The battlecard should be opinionated, not a neutral feature comparison.

## When to Use

- "Build a battlecard against [competitor]"
- "We keep losing deals to [competitor] — help me understand why"
- "What are [competitor]'s weaknesses we can exploit?"
- "Prep the sales team for competitive deals against [competitor]"
- "Research [competitor] and give me competitive positioning"

## Phase 0: Intake

1. **Your product name + URL**
2. **Competitor name + URL** — One competitor per battlecard (focused > broad)
3. **Deal context** — Where do you compete? (same ICP, upmarket/downmarket, different use case?)
4. **Known win/loss signals** — Any patterns from deals you've won or lost against them?
5. **Sales team size** — Are reps technical or business-focused? (affects language level)
6. **Existing positioning** — Your one-line positioning vs this competitor (if any)

## Phase 1: Competitor Research

### 1A: Website & Messaging Analysis

```
Fetch: [competitor] homepage, pricing page, about page, product page
Search: "[competitor]" "we help" OR "the only" OR "unlike"
Search: "[competitor]" case study OR customer story
```

Extract:
- **Hero claim** — their primary positioning
- **Category** — what category do they place themselves in?
- **Target audience** — who do they say they serve?
- **Key features emphasized** — what do they lead with?
- **Social proof** — customer logos, metrics, quotes
- **Pricing structure** — plans, pricing model, enterprise vs self-serve

### 1B: Review Intelligence

```
Search: "[competitor]" site:g2.com OR site:capterra.com
Search: "[competitor]" reviews "switched from" OR "moved to"
```

From reviews, extract:
- **Top 5 praised features** (their moat — don't compete here directly)
- **Top 5 complaints** (your attack angles)
- **Switching signals** — why do customers leave?
- **ICP patterns** — what roles/company sizes review them?

### 1C: Ad & Content Analysis

```
Search: "[competitor]" advertisement OR sponsored
Search: "[competitor]" vs OR alternative OR compare
```

Extract:
- **Ad messaging** — what claims do they pay to promote?
- **Comparison pages** — have they published "us vs X" pages?
- **Content themes** — what topics do they create content around?

### 1D: Social & Community Signals

```
Search: "[competitor]" site:reddit.com OR site:twitter.com complaints OR issues
Search: "[competitor]" "looking for alternative" OR "anyone use"
```

Extract:
- **Common frustrations** discussed publicly
- **Feature requests** their users are vocal about
- **Sentiment patterns** — do users love or tolerate them?

### 1E: Pricing Deep Dive

```
Fetch: [competitor] pricing page
Search: "[competitor]" pricing OR cost OR "how much"
```

Map their pricing:
- **Model:** Per seat / usage-based / flat rate / hybrid
- **Tiers:** What's in each tier?
- **Free tier:** What's included? What's gated?
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing? What triggers enterprise sales?
- **Hidden costs:** Implementation, overages, add-ons?
