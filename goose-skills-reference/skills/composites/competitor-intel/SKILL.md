Then run an agent research session to populate the profile.

### Daily: Reddit + Twitter Monitoring

```bash
# Run daily signals collection (automated via cron)
python3 competitor-intel/scripts/run_daily.py

# Or for a specific competitor
python3 competitor-intel/scripts/run_daily.py --competitor growthx
```

### Weekly: Deep Dive + LinkedIn
