# ICP Website Audit

The complete "how do buyers experience our site vs the competition?" workflow. Chains persona building, website evaluation, and competitive comparison into a single end-to-end audit.

## Quick Start

```
Run an ICP website audit for [company]. Site: [url]. Compare against [competitor 1] and [competitor 2].
```

With existing personas:
```
Run an ICP website audit for [client]. Personas already exist. Compare against [competitor urls].
```

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Source |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Company name** | Yes | User provides |
| **Company URL** | Yes | User provides |
| **Competitor URLs** | Yes (1-3) | User provides, or discovered in Phase 1 |
| **Client context file** | Optional | `clients/<client>/context.md` |
| **Existing personas** | Optional | `clients/<client>/personas/personas.json` |

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Persona Setup

**Check if personas already exist:**

```
clients/<client>/personas/personas.json
```

**If personas exist:** Load them, confirm they look current, and list them for the user. Skip to Phase 2.

**If no personas exist:** Run `icp-persona-builder`:

1. Research the company — what they sell, who they serve, pricing model, stage
2. Identify 4-6 ICP segments from website, case studies, reviews, job postings
3. Build detailed synthetic personas with full profiles
4. Save to `clients/<client>/personas/`

**Output from this phase:**
- `clients/<client>/personas/personas.json` (machine-readable)
- `clients/<client>/personas/personas.md` (human-readable)
- `clients/<client>/personas/segments.md` (summary table)

### Phase 2: Website Scorecard Review

Run `icp-website-review` in **scorecard mode** against the client's own site.

1. **Crawl the client's site** — homepage, pricing, product, solutions, about, case studies, blog, docs
2. **Check external presence** — search results, review sites, social proof
3. **Run each persona through the site**, scoring on:
   - First Impression (1-10)
   - Messaging Relevance (1-10)
   - Trust & Credibility (1-10)
   - Clarity & Navigation (1-10)
   - Objection Handling (1-10)
   - Overall (1-10)
4. **Cross-persona synthesis** — consensus issues, segment-specific gaps, messaging disconnects

**Output from this phase:**
- Per-persona scored reviews
- Cross-persona analysis
- Initial recommendations

### Phase 3: Competitive Head-to-Head

Run `icp-website-review` in **head-to-head mode** against each competitor.

For each competitor (1-3):

1. **Crawl the competitor's site** — same pages as the client site
2. **Run each persona through BOTH sites**
3. **Per-persona comparison:**
   - Quick takes on each site
   - Dimension-by-dimension scoring for both
   - "If I had to choose today..." verdict
   - What the client should steal from the competitor
   - What the client does better
4. **Cross-persona competitive summary:**
   - Where the client wins across personas
   - Where the competitor wins across personas
   - At-risk segments (personas who lean toward competitor)
   - Priority competitive moves

**Output from this phase:**
- Per-competitor, per-persona head-to-head reviews
- Competitive positioning map
- At-risk segments identified

### Phase 4: Consolidated Report

Merge all findings into a single audit report. This is the deliverable.

**Synthesis work:**

1. **Combine scorecard + competitive findings** — scorecard shows absolute quality, head-to-head shows relative positioning. Both perspectives matter.
2. **Identify the "so what"** — what are the 3-5 moves that would make the biggest difference?
3. **Rank recommendations by:**
   - How many personas it affects (breadth)
   - How much it would change conversion likelihood (depth)
   - Whether competitors already do it better (urgency)
   - Estimated effort (feasibility)
4. **Flag at-risk segments** — ICPs where competitors are winning. These need immediate attention.

## Parallelization

Some phases can run in parallel to save time:

```
Phase 1: Build personas (if needed)
    ↓
Phase 2 + Phase 3 can partially overlap:
  - Crawl all sites (client + competitors) at once
  - Run scorecard first (client site only)
  - Then run head-to-heads (reuse client crawl data)
    ↓
Phase 4: Consolidate (needs all prior phases)
```

If personas already exist, the whole workflow is just:
```
Crawl all sites → Scorecard → Head-to-heads → Consolidate
```

## Tips

- **Start with 1-2 competitors, not 5.** Each competitor adds a full head-to-head evaluation pass. Start focused, add more if needed.
- **The at-risk segments are the most actionable finding.** If a persona consistently prefers a competitor, that's an ICP segment you're actively losing deals in. That should drive urgency.
- **Reuse this quarterly.** Run personas once, then re-run the audit after site changes or quarterly to track improvement. Compare scores across dates.
- **Combine with SEO content audit for the full picture.** ICP audit tells you "does the messaging work for buyers?" SEO audit tells you "are buyers finding you in the first place?" Together they cover the full funnel.
- **This makes a great client deliverable.** The consolidated report is structured for sharing. Use `content-asset-creator` to make it into a polished HTML report.
- **Don't skip the competitive analysis.** The scorecard alone is useful, but the head-to-head is where the real insights are. Buyers always compare — your audit should too.
