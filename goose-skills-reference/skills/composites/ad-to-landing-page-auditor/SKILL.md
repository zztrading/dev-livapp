# Ad-to-Landing Page Auditor

The #1 reason ads get clicks but not conversions: the landing page doesn't deliver on the ad's promise. This skill audits the full click path — from ad copy to landing page experience — and flags every disconnect.

**Core principle:** A great ad with a mismatched landing page is worse than a mediocre ad with a matched one. Message match is the single biggest conversion lever most startups ignore.

## When to Use

- "Why are my ads getting clicks but no conversions?"
- "Audit my ad-to-landing page flow"
- "Check message match on our campaigns"
- "My conversion rate is low — help me figure out why"
- "Review our landing pages for our ad campaigns"

## Phase 0: Intake

1. **Ad data** — One of:
   - Ad copy + landing page URLs (manual list)
   - CSV export from ad platform
   - "Scrape my active ads" (uses ad scrapers on your domain)
2. **Platform(s)** — Google Search / Meta / LinkedIn / All
3. **Conversion goal** — What should happen after someone clicks? (Demo / Trial / Purchase / Download)
4. **Known conversion rates?** — Current click → conversion rate per ad/LP

## Phase 1: Ad Inventory

### If User Provides Ad Data

Parse the provided ads into:

| Ad ID | Platform | Headline | Body/Description | CTA | Landing Page URL | Conv Rate (if known) |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------------|-----|-----------------|---------------------|

### If Scraping Own Ads

Run `meta-ad-scraper` and/or `google-ad-scraper` on the user's domain to capture active ads.

## Phase 2: Landing Page Audit

For each unique landing page URL:

```
Fetch: [landing_page_url]
```

Extract and score:

### 2A: Content Elements

| Element | Found? | Content |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Hero headline** | [Y/N] | "[Text]" |
| **Subheadline** | [Y/N] | "[Text]" |
| **Primary CTA** | [Y/N] | "[Button text]" |
| **CTA above fold** | [Y/N] | — |
| **Social proof** | [Y/N] | [Logos / testimonials / metrics] |
| **Benefit list** | [Y/N] | [Key benefits listed] |
| **Form / Sign-up** | [Y/N] | [Field count: N] |
| **Video** | [Y/N] | — |
| **Trust signals** | [Y/N] | [Security badges, guarantees] |

### 2B: Message Match Scoring

For each ad → landing page pair, score on:

| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Criteria |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Promise continuity** | [X] | Does the LP headline deliver on the ad's promise? |
| **Language match** | [X] | Does the LP use the same words/phrases as the ad? |
| **Visual continuity** | [X] | Does the LP feel like a continuation of the ad? (Not assessable for search) |
| **CTA alignment** | [X] | Does the LP's ask match what the ad implied? |
| **Specificity match** | [X] | If the ad was specific ("for sales teams"), is the LP specific too? |
| **Emotional match** | [X] | If the ad used fear/urgency, does the LP carry that forward? |

**Message Match Score: [Average/60]**

### Scoring Guide

| Score | Rating | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 50-60 | Excellent | Strong match — LP delivers on every ad promise |
| 40-49 | Good | Minor disconnects but overall coherent |
| 30-39 | Needs work | Noticeable gaps — visitor has to hunt for relevance |
| 20-29 | Poor | Ad and LP feel like different products |
| Below 20 | Critical | Complete mismatch — fix immediately |

## Phase 3: Conversion Friction Analysis

Beyond message match, assess landing page conversion friction:

| Friction Type | Check | Status |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| **Load time** | Does the page feel heavy/slow? (Asset count proxy) | [Fast/Slow/Unknown] |
| **Form length** | How many fields before conversion? | [N fields] — [Appropriate/Too many] |
| **CTA clarity** | Is there one clear CTA or competing actions? | [Clear/Cluttered] |
| **Above-fold conversion** | Can someone convert without scrolling? | [Yes/No] |
| **Social proof placement** | Is proof near the CTA? | [Yes/No] |
| **Navigation distraction** | Does the LP have full site nav? (Should be minimal) | [Minimal/Full nav] |
| **Mobile experience** | Any mobile-unfriendly elements? | [Good/Issues] |
