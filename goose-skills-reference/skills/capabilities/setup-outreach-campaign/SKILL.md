## Setup

Requires a Smartlead account with API access.

```bash
export SMARTLEAD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

All API calls go to `https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1` with `?api_key=$SMARTLEAD_API_KEY` appended.

Rate limit: 10 requests per 2 seconds.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Gather Campaign Info

Ask the user the following questions. Group them conversationally — don't dump all at once.

**Campaign identity:**
- "What is the name for this campaign?" (e.g., "Truewind - Accounting Firms - Feb 2026")
- "What is the goal?" (e.g., book demos, drive trial signups, conference follow-up)

**Audience & leads:**
- "Who is the target audience?" (ICP: title, company type, size, industry)
- "How are you providing the lead list?" — options: CSV file, output from a prior skill (company-contact-finder, luma-event-attendees), or "I need to find leads first" (chain to company-contact-finder)

**Messaging:**
- "What is the core value proposition or pain point?"
- "What is the call to action?" (e.g., "Book a 15-min demo")
- "What tone — casual, semi-formal, or formal?"
- "Any personalization angle?" (e.g., reference their job posting, event, industry news)

**Schedule:**
- "What days should emails be sent?" (default: Mon-Fri)
- "What hours and timezone?" (default: 8am-6pm ET)
- "Max new leads per day?" (default: 20)
- "When should the campaign start?" (default: tomorrow)

**Mailboxes:**
- "How many mailboxes to allocate?" (default: 5)
- "Auto-select free mailboxes, or show me a list to choose from?"

After gathering answers, present a summary and confirm before proceeding.

### Step 2: Create the Campaign

```
POST https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/create?api_key=$SMARTLEAD_API_KEY

Body:
{
  "name": "<campaign_name>",
  "client_id": null
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "id": 3023,
  "name": "Test email campaign",
  "created_at": "2022-11-07T16:23:24.025929+00:00"
}
```

Capture `campaign_id` from `id`. All subsequent calls use this.

### Step 3: Find and Allocate Mailboxes

This step determines which mailboxes are available and assigns them to the campaign.

#### 3a: Fetch all email accounts

```
GET https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/email-accounts/?api_key=$SMARTLEAD_API_KEY&offset=0&limit=100
```

Returns a list of all email accounts with `id`, `from_email`, `from_name`, `daily_sent_count`, `warmup_details`, `is_smtp_success`, `is_imap_success`.

#### 3b: Identify which mailboxes are currently in use

Fetch all campaigns:

```
GET https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns?api_key=$SMARTLEAD_API_KEY
```

For each campaign with `status` = `"ACTIVE"` or `"STARTED"`, fetch its email accounts:

```
GET https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/email-accounts?api_key=$SMARTLEAD_API_KEY
```

Build a set of all `email_account_id` values currently assigned to active campaigns.

#### 3c: Filter for free mailboxes

A mailbox is "free" if:
1. Its `id` is NOT in the active-campaign set from 3b
2. `is_smtp_success` = true AND `is_imap_success` = true (account is functional)

Sort free mailboxes by `daily_sent_count` ascending (prefer coolest/least-used mailboxes).

#### 3d: Select and assign

If `mailbox_selection` = "auto": select the first N free mailboxes.

If `mailbox_selection` = "manual": display all accounts as a table (name, email, daily_sent_count, status) and let the user pick.

If fewer than N free mailboxes are available, tell the user: "Only X free mailboxes found. Proceed with X, or pick some currently-in-use mailboxes?"

Assign selected mailboxes:

```
POST https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/email-accounts?api_key=$SMARTLEAD_API_KEY

Body:
{
  "email_account_ids": [101, 204, 305, 412, 518]
}
```

### Step 4: Ingest Leads

#### 4a: Parse the lead list

**From CSV:** Read the file, map columns to Smartlead fields. Flexible column matching:
- `email` (required) — also matches `Email`, `email_address`
- `first_name` — also matches `firstname`, `first`, `First Name`
- `last_name` — also matches `lastname`, `last`, `Last Name`
- `company_name` — also matches `company`, `organization`, `Company`
- Any extra columns become `custom_fields`

**From upstream skill (person-list JSON):** Map fields:
```
first_name  <- name.split()[0]
last_name   <- name.split()[1:]
email       <- email
company_name <- company
custom_fields <- { "title": title, "linkedin_url": linkedin_url }
```

#### 4b: Validate and deduplicate

- Remove rows without a valid email
- Deduplicate by email (keep first occurrence)
- Report: total rows, valid, invalid, duplicates removed

#### 4c: Upload in batches

Smartlead accepts max 100 leads per call. Chunk the list and call for each batch:

```
POST https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/leads?api_key=$SMARTLEAD_API_KEY

Body:
{
  "lead_list": [
    {
      "first_name": "Jane",
      "last_name": "Smith",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "company_name": "Acme Corp",
      "custom_fields": {"title": "CFO"}
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "ignore_global_block_list": false,
    "ignore_unsubscribe_list": false,
    "ignore_duplicate_leads_in_other_campaign": false
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "upload_count": 95,
  "total_leads": 100,
  "already_added_to_campaign": 2,
  "duplicate_count": 1,
  "invalid_email_count": 2,
  "unsubscribed_leads": 0
}
```

Report totals across all batches to the user.

### Step 5: Craft the Email Sequence

Write a 2-3 email sequence based on the user's inputs from Step 1. Default structure:

**Email 1 — Cold intro (Day 0)**
- Subject: short, curiosity-driven or relevant to their pain
- Body: 3-5 sentences. Acknowledge their world, surface the problem, introduce the solution briefly, clear CTA
- Personalize with `{{first_name}}` and any custom fields

**Email 2 — Follow-up (Day 3)**
- Subject: different angle (metric, case study, specific outcome)
- Body: 2-4 sentences. Add value, restate CTA
- Leave subject blank to send as same-thread reply

**Email 3 — Breakup (Day 8)**
- Subject: brief, direct ("Still relevant?", "Closing the loop")
- Body: 2-3 sentences. Acknowledge they're busy, keep door open, soft CTA

Present the full sequence to the user as a formatted table. Wait for approval or edits.

After user approves, save:

```
POST https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/sequences?api_key=$SMARTLEAD_API_KEY

Body:
{
  "sequences": [
    {
      "seq_number": 1,
      "seq_delay_details": { "delay_in_days": 0 },
      "seq_variants": [
        {
          "subject": "Subject line here",
          "email_body": "<p>Email body as HTML</p>",
          "variant_label": "A"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "seq_number": 2,
      "seq_delay_details": { "delay_in_days": 3 },
      "seq_variants": [
        {
          "subject": "",
          "email_body": "<p>Follow-up body</p>",
          "variant_label": "A"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "seq_number": 3,
      "seq_delay_details": { "delay_in_days": 5 },
      "seq_variants": [
        {
          "subject": "",
          "email_body": "<p>Breakup body</p>",
          "variant_label": "A"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: blank `subject` on emails 2+ makes them send as replies in the same thread.

### Step 6: Set the Schedule

```
POST https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/schedule?api_key=$SMARTLEAD_API_KEY

Body:
{
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "days_of_the_week": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  "start_hour": "08:00",
  "end_hour": "18:00",
  "min_time_btw_emails": 10,
  "max_new_leads_per_day": 20,
  "schedule_start_time": "2026-02-25T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`days_of_the_week`: 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday.

### Step 7: Confirm and Optionally Start

Present a full summary:

```
Campaign: "Truewind - Accounting Firms - Feb 2026"
Campaign ID: 12345
Leads added: 87 (3 rejected as duplicates)
Email sequence: 3 emails (Day 0, Day 3, Day 8)
Schedule: Mon-Fri, 8am-6pm ET, starting Feb 25
Mailboxes: jane@truewind.ai, alex@truewind.ai (+3 more)
Status: DRAFTED
```

Ask: "Do you want to START the campaign now, or leave it as a draft?"

If start:
```
POST https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/status?api_key=$SMARTLEAD_API_KEY

Body:
{ "status": "START" }
```

If draft: skip. User can start from Smartlead UI later.

## Optional: Update Campaign Settings

If the user wants to configure tracking or stop conditions, use:

```
POST https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/settings?api_key=$SMARTLEAD_API_KEY

Body:
{
  "track_settings": ["DONT_TRACK_EMAIL_OPEN"],
  "stop_lead_settings": "REPLY_TO_AN_EMAIL",
  "send_as_plain_text": false,
  "follow_up_percentage": 100,
  "enable_ai_esp_matching": true
}
```

Allowed `track_settings`: `DONT_TRACK_EMAIL_OPEN`, `DONT_TRACK_LINK_CLICK`, `DONT_TRACK_REPLY_TO_AN_EMAIL`
Allowed `stop_lead_settings`: `REPLY_TO_AN_EMAIL`, `CLICK_ON_A_LINK`, `OPEN_AN_EMAIL`
