# Database Search Sequence (Lean Signal)

For leads sourced from `crustdata-supabase` or other database searches. These leads match the ICP by firmographic and demographic criteria but have no engagement signal. You know their title, company, and industry — that's it.

**Strategy:** Since there's no behavioral signal, lead with relevance to their role and industry. Do the research to make it feel personal even with lean data.

**Available personalization variables:**
- `{first_name}`, `{last_name}`, `{company}`, `{title}`, `{industry}`
- `{location}` — their location
- `{company_size}` — company headcount range
- `{qualification_score}` — their ICP score (if qualified)

## Step 1: Connection Request (300 chars max)

### Variant A — Role-based relevance
```
{first_name} — connecting with {title}s in {industry} who are thinking about [problem area]. We work with similar companies. Would enjoy connecting.
```

### Variant B — Company-specific
```
Hey {first_name}, been following what {company} is doing in {industry}. We help similar teams with [specific challenge]. Let's connect.
```

### Variant C — Peer network
```
{first_name} — I work with a lot of {title}s in {industry}. One topic that keeps coming up: [problem area]. Would be great to get your perspective. Let's connect.
```

**Guidance:** With lean signal, the connection request needs to work harder. Research the company briefly before generating — check their LinkedIn page, recent news, or job postings for something specific to reference.

## Step 2: Follow-up 1 — Value-First (Day 3)

### Variant A — Industry insight
```
Thanks for connecting, {first_name}. One thing I keep hearing from {title}s at {company_size}-person {industry} companies: [common pain point for this segment].

Is that on your radar at {company}, or is something else eating up more of your time?
```

### Variant B — Question-led
```
Appreciate the connection. Quick question for you — as a {title} at {company}, what's your biggest operational bottleneck right now?

I ask because we work with a lot of {industry} teams and the answers usually cluster around 2-3 themes. Curious where {company} falls.
```

### Variant C — Trend reference
```
Thanks for connecting, {first_name}. I've been digging into how {industry} companies are handling [relevant trend] this year.

The split is interesting: about 60% are still doing it the old way, 40% have found a shortcut. Curious which camp {company} is in?
```

## Step 3: Follow-up 2 — Social Proof (Day 7)

### Variant A — Case study
```
{first_name}, quick one: a {industry} company about {company}'s size just solved their [problem area] challenge. Went from [before state] to [after state] in [timeframe].

The approach was surprisingly simple. Happy to share — 15 minutes, no strings.
```

### Variant B — Peer benchmarking
```
I just compiled data from {N} {industry} companies on how they handle [problem area]. The results were eye-opening — especially for teams at {company}'s stage.

Want me to send you the highlights?
```

---

## Step 4: Follow-up 3 — Breakup (Day 14)

### Variant A
```
{first_name} — I'll stop here. If [problem area] ever becomes a priority, I'm a good person to have in your network. No pressure either way.
```

### Variant B
```
Last note from me. If the timing isn't right, totally get it. When [problem area] comes back around for {company}, let's talk then.
```

---

## Step 5: InMail — Standalone (Day 7, if connection not accepted)

### Subject (200 chars max)
**Variant A:** `{title}s in {industry} keep asking about this`
**Variant B:** `Quick question for the {company} team`
**Variant C:** `{first_name} — relevant to what {company} is building`

### Body (1,900 chars max)

**Variant A — Role relevance:**
```
Hi {first_name},

I'm reaching out because we work with a lot of {title}s in {industry}, and there's a pattern I thought you'd find interesting.

Most {company_size}-person companies in your space hit a specific bottleneck around [problem area] as they scale. The teams that solve it early tend to grow faster and with less pain. The ones that don't end up throwing bodies at the problem.

We've helped {N}+ {industry} companies navigate this, including:
- [Company type] that reduced [metric] by [X]%
- [Company type] that scaled from [Y] to [Z] without adding headcount in [department]

I don't know if this is on {company}'s radar right now, but if it is, a 15-minute conversation could be valuable. If it's not, happy to just stay connected for when it does come up.

Worth a quick chat?

Best,
[Sender name]
```

**Variant B — Shorter, curiosity-driven:**
```
Hi {first_name},

Two quick questions:
1. Is [problem area] a current priority at {company}?
2. If so, have you started evaluating solutions, or still figuring out the approach?

I ask because we've helped {N} {industry} companies with exactly this, and I can usually tell within 5 minutes whether our approach would be relevant.

If it's not a priority, no worries — I appreciate you reading this far.

Best,
[Sender name]
```
